# EscapeRoomGame


helo boiz en girls itsa me mariolette



## changes

I basically rewrote the thing in native canvas js. PhaserJS is just way too annoying and "long" to get into.

There's still some shit I have to do.

## todos:
* Add Animations 
* Add a proper timer
* fix the fucking freezing events issue when using browsers popups
* try to fix the blurry pixel art 
* add proper comments so the teachers don't shit themselves
* fix the spritesheet (bitch is offset by some pixels here and there)
* find a good way of adding sound into the game
* yk fuck it just make a whole ass sound manager 
* release the children from my basement
*
